            <h1>1st International Conference in Cloud Computing </h1>

            <h3>
                July 15-16 | Bronx NY | Virtual + Onsite
            </h3>

            <p>
                This is the first annual Cloud Computing Conference at Lehman College. The conference series
                will feature keynote talks, special sessions, poster presentation, tutorials, workshops, and
                contributed papers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of the conference is to be a premier venue for researchers and industry practitioners to
                share new ideas, research results and development experiences in various fields. This will be one
                of a kind in the Bronx.
            </p>

                Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications to storage
                and processing power. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
                economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
                companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that
                cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved
                manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust
                resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing
                capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.

            <img src = "images/profile.png" id = "profile_pic"> 

            <p> Hi, my name is Jose Nunez. I am a graduating senior majoring in Computer Science. Throughout my four years at Lehman I have taken 
                a few programming courses which include: Programmming I, Programming II, Data Structures and Algorithms. This semester I am taking 
                two classes that require programming, these two classes are Artifical Intelligence and Programmming through Web Development. I also participated 
                in a web development workshop at Lehman with a company called Revature. The reason why I decided to take this web development class is 
                because I have always been interested in web development ever since I did a little of web development in middle school. I can say that 
                since middle school I have always wanted to do some web development but never set the time to do it myself, so when I found this class 
                it was a no brainer for me.
            </p>

            <p> My top three jobs in no particular order are IT Support Manager, Front End Developer, and Project Manager. I am interested in starting out as 
                an IT support specialist and then work my way up to eventually become a manager. This job is in my top list because I enjoy helping people solve 
                their technical difficulties. I like this job because it is something that I can relate to. Any time someone in my family has any questions, 
                problems with a device, or anything to do with technology, I am the one they call. The other top job I would wish to have is a front end developer. 
                I know that this job has a good job outlook since people will always need websites. Another reason why I am interested in being a front end developer 
                is because I am intrigued by what we are learning in this web development class. The last job is being a project manager. I prefer this job because I 
                like the concept of being able to take a customers idea, then intepret those ideas, which would later be taken to your team who ultimately create an 
                end product that satisfies the customers needs.
            </p>

            <p> 
                My six favorite foods:
                <ol>
                    <li>Tacos <a href= "https://www.tacobell.com/"> Order Tacos</a></li>
                    <li>Pizza <a href= "https://www.dominos.com/en/"> Order Pizza</a></li>
                    <li>Potato Salad</li>

                Three countries I would like to visit:
                <ul>
                    <li>United Kingdom</li>
                    <li>France</li>
                    <li>Japan</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p> My favorite movie of all time is a movie called <b>Never Back Down</b>. It was released in 2008 and it is about a guy who is being bullied <br> 
                in his new school and decides to learn Mixed Martial Arts in order to defend himself.
